544,muv,Generator for Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV) datasets in virtual screening,"A Python tool designed to generate Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV) datasets for benchmarking virtual screening methods. It implements algorithms to select active and decoy molecules that are topologically distinct but share similar physical properties, thereby removing artificial enrichment bias and providing a rigorous standard for validating docking and scoring functions.",S3;S3-06,dataset_generation;benchmarking;validation,library,Python,https://github.com/skearnes/muv,,BSD-3-Clause,virtual-screening;benchmarking;drug-discovery;dataset-generation;muv
